# Example Solutions for Workbook

- Used with The *Python Workbook* by B. Stephenson (**Springer**, 2014)
  - These are the example answers used in teaching a Python course
  - Not every example was used (as noted or just skipped)
- There are also self made examples which are indicted in each specific program.

#### Note on Examples
This is used with Junior-level (undergrad) Data analytic courses.
The idea is that the students already have a general understanding
of programming (with Java & C++) but have not encountered data analytic
applications of programming.

> There was also an expectation of full completion
> of calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and discrete math courses.
> So the math concepts only received a cursory review, with the course
> focused on application.

Do to this, the class will move very quickly through the first chapters in
the workbook and the solutions provided are too elementary. They also
required a small update in a few places - as is to be expected after 10+ years.
