# Example Solutions for Workbook

- Example Answers for problems proposed by The *Python Workbook* by B. Stephenson (**Springer**, 2014)
  - These were used in teaching a Python course
  - Not every example was used (as noted or just skipped)
- There are also self made examples which are indicted in each specific program.

#### Note on Examples
This is also used with Junior & Senior level (undergrad) Data analytic courses.
The idea is that the students already have a general understanding
of programming (with Java & C++) but have not encountered data analytic
applications of programming.

> There was also an expectation of full completion of at least calculus & statistics with some students having completed linear algebra and discrete math courses. So the math concepts only received a cursory review, with the course focused on application.

Due to this, the class moved very quickly through the first chapters in the 
workbook and found the solutions that were provided were too elementary. They also
required a small update in a few places (yeah! type hints) - as is to be expected after 10+ years.

#### Modules
- **Module 1**: Basic input and output using the console and standard control structures
- **Module 2**: More detailed look at control and data structures with introduction to loops
- **Module 3**: File input and output with a Bag of Words project
- **Module 4**: Single program at the moment which shows a basic graph (will expand with a game example soon)
- **Module 5**: Using parallel operations (threading)
- **Review 1**: Classes with type hinting and basic review of math
