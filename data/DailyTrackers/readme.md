All files in this directory are used with:
1. Demonstration of local ETL process
2. CSV/JSON reading assignment 
3. Demonstrate one of the ways data is created in "Real World" (I wish macro enabled Excel wasn't a thing)
4. Will have several analysis projects from the data provided (using standard analysis techniques)

*All data is made up and the points don't matter.*
