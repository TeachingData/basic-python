### Graphing and recursion are large subjects
And highly related: so I will do my best to seperate and sort these in a way that makes sense. The files here assume you already know basic recursion and focus more on its usage with data structures for analysis and other processes.

Files with be named with steps:
1. Create basic graph using dictionary and find a path by determining adjacent nodes (forward and back) using recursion
    - Will also perform a "find all paths" function
2. Use the idea of 1 but make it a graph that we build with a user (like them choosing where they go)
    - We will add a function to see how far from end node and if decisions are making it farther or closer
    - If we are looking at how far we will also have a shortest_path variable/function
3. Optimizing all this and looking at methods like "breath first search" and others
4. Printing Graphes
