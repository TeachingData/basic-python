Park visitation is at a record high good for tourism not so good for peace and quiet From Acadia to Zion Bryce Canyon to Yosemite
leading writers and environmentalists share their alternatives to the most popular spots

When you think of stunning waterscapes places like Acadia national park in Maine and Olympic national park in Washington 
probably come to mind Yet Voyageurs national park in Minnesota offers some of the same activities with a fraction of the crowds 
Almost half the park is water with more than 500 islands and 655 miles of undeveloped shoreline As someone who grew up in the Rockies
lived near the mountains of California and adventured in Alaska I can tell you that Voyageurs is like no place else
Start your adventure at either Kabetogama Lake visitor center or Ash river visitor center Rent a boat canoe or kayak and set out 
for a campsite across the water From there you can spend the day fishing or cruising around If you are visiting in July the wild 
blueberries and raspberries are ripe for picking and make an excellent addition to your campfire pancakes There is beauty in taking 
a break from modern conveniences When flipped over the bottom of your canoe provides a great surface to prep your food 
and perhaps is a better tabletop than a picnic table

At Voyageurs you can wrap yourself in quiet that is both comforting and exhilarating We are not talking complete silence but 
rather a silence that gives you space to enjoy the calls of wildlife from miles around It is one of my most favorite aspects of 
this park you can literally go an entire day without hearing any human sounds
