Olympic sports are contested in the Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games The 2016 Summer Olympics included 28 sports with 
five additional sports due to be added to the 2020 Summer Olympics program which was postponed to at least 2021 due to the COVID-19 
pandemic the 2014 Winter Olympics included seven sports The number and types of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to 
another Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body namely an International Federation or IF 
The International Olympic Committee or IOC establishes a hierarchy of sports disciplines and events According to this hierarchy 
each Olympic sport can be subdivided into multiple disciplines which are often mistaken as distinct sports Examples include swimming 
and water polo which are in fact disciplines of the sport of aquatics represented by the International Swimming Federation and 
figure skating and speed skating which are both disciplines of the sport of ice skating represented by the International 
Skating Union In turn disciplines are subdivided into events for which Olympic medals are awarded A sport or discipline is included 
in the Olympic program if the IOC determines it to be widely practiced around the world that is the popularity of a given sport or 
discipline is indicated by the number of countries that compete in it The IOC requirements also reflect participation in the Olympic 
Games more stringent conditions are applied to men sports or disciplines as men are represented at the Games in higher numbers than 
women and to summer sports or disciplines as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics than in the Winter Olympics

Previous Olympic Games included sports that are no longer included in the current program such as polo and tug of war Known as 
discontinued sports these have been removed due to either a lack of interest or the absence of an appropriate governing body for the 
sport Some sports that were competed at the early Games and later dropped by the IOC have managed to return to the Olympic program 
for example Archery which made a comeback in 1972 and tennis which was reintroduced in 1988 The Olympics have often included one or 
more demonstration sports normally to promote a local sport from the host country or to gauge interest in an entirely new sport 
Some such sports like baseball and curling were added to the official Olympic program in 1992 and 1998 respectively Baseball was 
discontinued after the 2008 Olympics in Beijing only to be revived again for the forthcoming 2020 Olympics in Tokyo which will see 
the introduction of new disciplines within a number of existing Summer Olympics sports as well as several new sports such as karate 
and skateboarding making their Olympic debuts

The term sport in Olympic terminology refers to all events sanctioned by an international sport federation a definition that may 
differ from the common meaning of the word sport One sport by Olympic definition may comprise several disciplines which would often 
be regarded as separate sports in common usage

For example aquatics is a summer Olympic sport that includes six disciplines swimming synchronized swimming diving water polo open 
water swimming and high diving the last of which is a non-Olympic discipline since all these disciplines are governed at 
international level by the International Swimming Federation Skating is a winter Olympic sport represented by the International 
Skating Union and includes four disciplines figure skating speed skating on a traditional long track short track speed skating and 
synchronized skating the latter is a non-Olympic discipline The sport with the largest number of Olympic disciplines is skiing with 
six alpine skiing cross-country skiing ski jumping nordic combined snowboarding and freestyle skiing

Other notable multi-discipline sports are gymnastics artistic rhythmic and trampoline cycling road track mountain and BMX volleyball 
indoors and beach wrestling freestyle and Greco-Roman canoeing flatwater and slalom and bobsleigh includes skeleton The disciplines 
listed here are only those contested in the Olympics gymnastics has two non-Olympic disciplines while cycling and wrestling have 
three each

The IOC definition of a discipline may differ from that used by an international federation For example the IOC considers artistic 
gymnastics a single discipline but the International Federation of Gymnastics classifies men and women artistic gymnastics as 
separate disciplines Similarly the IOC considers freestyle wrestling to be a single discipline but United World Wrestling uses 
freestyle wrestling strictly for the men version classifying women freestyle wrestling as the separate discipline of female 
wrestling

On some occasions notably in the case of snowboarding the IOC agreed to add a sport that previously had a separate international 
federation to the Olympics on condition that they dissolve their governing body and instead affiliate with an existing Olympic sport 
federation therefore not increasing the number of Olympic sports

On August 3rd 2016 the IOC voted to add baseball softball karate sport-climbing surfing and skateboarding for the 2020 Summer 
Olympics
